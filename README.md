# ReviewCommentsManagement
 
## Introduction 
In this solo project, I built an application called Review Comments Management (RCM). This application is intended to track the project's source code review comments and is used to ensure that the code review process was completed satisfactorily (i.e., reviews were completed, and feedback was addressed).
User can run this application to track the code review in Java.
